## Monte Carlo (Method or Simulation) :

Monte Carlo simulation is a mathematical technique which is used to estimate the possible outcomes of an uncertain event.

Monte Carlo generally refers to the synonym for randomness in gambling.

Monte Carlo Simulations are Simulations evolving randomly.

The core idea of Monte Carlo Simulation is that we can get an unbiased, representative group of samples from some large ocean of possibilities if we allow the simulation to evolve randomly.

So in this it states that :
  + More sample paths **_leads to_** less noisy image.

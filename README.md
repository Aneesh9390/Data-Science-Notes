## Monte Carlo (Method or Simulation) :

Monte Carlo simulation is a mathematical technique which is used to estimate the possible outcomes of an uncertain event.

Monte Carlo generally refers to the synonym for randomness in gambling.

Monte Carlo Simulations are Simulations evolving randomly.

Random sampling is used to generate multiple possible outcomes and calculate the average result.

The core idea of Monte Carlo Simulation is that we can get an unbiased, representative group of samples from some large ocean of possibilities if we allow the simulation to evolve randomly.

So in this it states that :
  + More sample paths **_leads to_** less noisy image. 

### Applicatins :
Most applications are in the area of :
  + Portfolio Management
  + Investment Planning

Other common appli are things like :
  + Risk analysis
  + Option pricing
  + Planning for spare capacity

***Monte Carlo Technique involves 3 basic steps :***
  1. Set up predictive model :
    + This is identifying both the dependent variable to be predicted and the independent variables, also known as the input risk of predictive variables that will drive the predictions.
